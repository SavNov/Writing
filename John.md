# John
As John placed his laptop on the desk in the lab, he opened it and wrote a line of code into the terminal. As he pressed enter, the script he'd written and debugged six separate times already ran.

The screen beeped at another failed attempt. He scoffed. 

"I want to destroy this thing so badly..." He sighed, but he couldn't afford a new work laptop and he knew it. 

His entire work in the lab had been dedicated to Chrono-mapping, process of attempting to map out future events. Typically, that meant using statistical analysis on past data in order to predict future data, or constructing some kind of neural network. This most recent job was different, though. 

He was going to establish a point in the present, and a point in the future to link it to. One would be able to talk to the other. 

He twiddled his thumbs on the keyboard as it ran again, and for some stupid reason, it started working. He needed to specify times. The time in the present to link, and the time in the future to link to. After all, when the future date eventually hit, he'd be delivering that message to his past self.

"Alright...let's try...*tomorrow*." He said to himself, trying not to get too excited just yet. After all, something else might be failing in the background and just not telling him about it.

Tomorrow at 6 pm.

The command ran. 

Ten seconds later, wearing the exact same labcoat, a version of him stared into the monitor right back at him. Immediately, both sides began cheering.

"It works! Oh my god it works!" Both shouted in unison.

Then both paused in unison. 

"How do I know you're from the future?" He asked the man standing in a room identical to his within the monitor.

A beat passed. The man looked down at a sheet of paper, and looked back at him. 

"Kayla is going to come in in about twenty seconds with donuts." The man said. 

He, Present John, took out a sheet of paper from beside him, and realized instantly that it was the same sheet of paper Future John had read from.

He watched the clock, pen in hand, and waited.

Ten seconds later, Kayla came in. She offered him a donut from a box, her brown hair mopped on her face and evidently wet.

"Thought you'd want one." She said frankly, never one to mince words.

He took it. 

John wrote down the exact time. 

Future John held up his own sheet, and Present John realized the writing was identical.
