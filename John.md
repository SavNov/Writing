# John
As John placed his laptop on the desk in the lab, he opened it and wrote a line of code into the terminal. As he pressed enter, the script he'd written and debugged six separate times already ran.
The screen beeped at another failed attempt. He scoffed. 
"I want to destroy this thing so badly..." He sighed, but he couldn't afford a new work laptop and he knew it. 
His entire work in the lab had been dedicated to Chrono-mapping, process of attempting to map out future events. Typically, that meant using statistical analysis on past data in order to predict future data, or constructing some kind of neural network. This most recent job was different, though. 
He was going to establish a point in the present, and a point in the future to link it to. One would be able to talk to the other. 
He twiddled his thumbs on the keyboard as it ran again, and for some stupid reason, it started working. He needed to specify times. The time in the present to link, and the time in the future to link to. After all, when the future date eventually hit, he'd be delivering that message to his past self.
